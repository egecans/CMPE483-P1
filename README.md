This project aims to build an autonomous decentralized governance token contract from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 token contract and then implement a web-based user interface that connects and runs on  Bloxberg, Ava, or Goerli test networks.

You can check the [Project Description for building contract](https://github.com/egecans/CMPE483-P1/blob/main/Project%20Description.pdf) and [Project Report](https://github.com/egecans/CMPE483-P1/blob/main/Report.pdf) for more information
